This is your input file
    
    Anything which is not one of the important characters will be ignored
    by the program
    
    The program is as follows:
    
       +[-
         [<<
          [+
           [--->]
          -[<<<]
         ]
        ]>>>-
       ]
    
    I'm guessing that you know where we're going with all this
    
       >-.---.>..>.<<<<-.<+.>>>>>.>.<<.<-.
    
    But perhaps you're as lost as a little lamb?
